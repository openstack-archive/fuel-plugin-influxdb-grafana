Installation Guide
==================

**InfluxDB-Grafana** plugin installation
----------------------------------------


To install the InfluxDB-Grafana plugin, follow these steps:

1. Download the plugin from the [Fuel Plugins
   Catalog](https://software.mirantis.com/download-mirantis-openstack-fuel-plug-ins/).

2. Copy the plugin file to the Fuel Master node. Follow the [Quick start
   guide](https://software.mirantis.com/quick-start/) if you don't have a running
   Fuel Master node yet.

   ```
   scp influxdb_grafana-0.8-0.8.0-0.noarch.rpm root@<the Fuel Master node IP address>:
   ```

3. Install the plugin using the `fuel` command line:

   ```
   fuel plugins --install influxdb_grafana-0.8-0.8.0-0.noarch.rpm
   ```

4. Verify that the plugin is installed correctly:

   ```
   fuel plugins
   ```

Please refer to the [Fuel Plugins wiki](https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Fuel/Plugins)
if you want to build the plugin by yourself, version 3.0.0 (or higher) of the Fuel
Plugin Builder is required.

User Guide
==========

**InfluxDB-Grafana** plugin configuration
---------------------------------------------

1. Create a new environment with the Fuel UI wizard.
2. Click on the Settings tab of the Fuel web UI.
3. Scroll down the page, select the "InfluxDB-Grafana Server plugin" tab,
   enable the plugin and fill-in the required fields.
    - The password for the InfluxDB root user.
    - The name of the database where you want to store your metrics.
    - The username and the password for this specific database.
    - The name and the password for the Grafana admin user.
4. Add a node with the "InfluxDB Grafana" role.

### Retention policy
By default, data is automatically deleted within the InfluxDB system after
30 days. You could want to adjust this retention period depending of your
requirements.

### Disks partitionning
The plugin uses:

- 20% of the first disk for the operating system by honoring the range of
  15Gb minimum and 50Gb maximum.
- 10Gb for /var/log.
- at least 30Gb for the Elasticsearch data (/opt/es-data).


Testing
-------

### InfluxDB

Once installed, you can check that InfluxDB is working using `curl`:

```
curl -G 'http://<HOST>:8086/'  \
  --data-urlencode "u=<root user of InfluxDB>" \
  --data-urlencode "p=<password of root user>" \
  --data-urlencode "q=show databases"
```

Where `HOST` is the IP address or the name of the node that runs the server and
credentials are those provided in the Fuel UI for the InfluxDB root user.

The curl command should return something similar to:

```
{"results":[{"series":[{"name":"databases","columns":["name"],"values":[["lma"]]}]}]}
```

### Grafana

Grafana is available at:

```
http://$HOST:8000/
```

You can login by using the username and password that you provided in the Fuel UI.

Known issues
------------

None.
