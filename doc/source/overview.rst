Overview
========

The **InfluxDB-Grafana Fuel Plugin** is used to install and configure
InfluxDB and Grafana which collectively provide access to the OpenStack
metrics analytics. InfluxDB is a powerful distributed time-series database
to store and search metrics time-series. The metrics analytics are used to
visualize the time-series and the annotations produced by the LMA Collector.
The annotations contain insightful information about the detected fault
or anomaly that triggered a change of state for a node cluster or service
cluster as well as textual hints about what might be the root cause of the
fault or anomaly.

The InfluxDB-Grafana Plugin is an indispensable tool to answering
the questions "what has changed in my OpenStack environment, when and why?".
Grafana is installed with a collection of predefined dashboards for each
of the OpenStack services that are monitored.
Among those dashboards, the *Main Dashboard* provides a single pane of glass
overview of your OpenStack environment status.

InfluxDB and Grafana are key components
of the `LMA Toolchain project <https://launchpad.net/lma-toolchain>`_
as shown in the figure below.

Requirements
------------


+------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Requirement**        | **Version/Comment**                                                                        |
+========================+============================================================================================+
| Disk space             | The plugin’s specification requires to provision at least 15GB of disk space for the       |
|                        | system, 10GB for the logs and 30GB for the database. The installation of the               |
|                        | plugin will fail if there is less than 55GB of disk space available on the node.           |

| Fuel                   | Mirantis OpenStack 8.0                                                                     |
+------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Hardware configuration | The hardware configuration (RAM, CPU, disk(s)) required by this plugin depends on the size |
|                        | of your cloud environment and other factors like the retention policy. An average          |
|                        | setup would require a quad-core server with 8 GB of RAM and access to a 500-1000 IOPS disk.|
|                        | Please check the `InfluxDB Hardware Sizing Guide                                           |
|                        | <https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v0.10/guides/hardware_sizing/>`_ for additional      |
|                        | sizing information.                                                                        |
|                        |                                                                                            |
|                        | It is also highly recommended to use a dedicated disk for your data storage. Otherwise,    |
|                        | The InfluxDB-Grafana Plugin will use the root filesystem by default.                       |

Limitations
-----------

Currently, the size of an InfluxDB cluster the Fuel plugin can deploy is limited to three nodes. In addition to this,
each node of the InfluxDB cluster is configured to run under the *meta* node role and the *data* node role. Therefore,
it is not possible using the Fuel plugin, to separate the nodes participating in the Raft consensus cluster from
the nodes accessing the data replicas.
