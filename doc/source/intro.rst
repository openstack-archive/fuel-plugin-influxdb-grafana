Introduction
------------

The **StackLight InfluxDB-Grafana Plugin for Fuel** is used to install and
configure InfluxDB and Grafana, which collectively provide access to the
metrics analytics of Mirantis OpenStack. InfluxDB is a powerful distributed
time-series database to store and search metrics time-series. The metrics
analytics are used to visualize the time-series and the annotations produced
by the StackLight Collector. The annotations contain insightful information
about the faults and anomalies that resulted in a change of state for the
clusters of nodes and services of the OpenStack environment.

The InfluxDB-Grafana plugin is an indispensable tool to answer the questions 
of what has changed in your OpenStack environment, when, and why. Grafana is
installed with a collection of predefined dashboards for each of the OpenStack
services that are monitored. Among those dashboards, the *Main Dashboard*
provides a single pane of glass overview of your OpenStack environment status.

InfluxDB and Grafana are the key components of the `LMA Toolchain project <https://launchpad.net/lma-toolchain>`_ as shown in the figure below.
