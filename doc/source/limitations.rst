Limitations
-----------

The StackLight InfluxDB-Grafana plugin 0.10.1 has the following limitation:

* The size of an InfluxDB cluster the Fuel plugin can deploy is limited to
  three nodes. Additionally, each node of the InfluxDB cluster is configured to
  run under the *meta* node role and the *data* node role. Therefore, it is not
  possible to separate the nodes participating in the Raft consensus cluster
  from the nodes accessing the data replicas.
